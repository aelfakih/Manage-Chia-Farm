# Manage-Chia-Farm
This program helps chia farmers manage the thousands of plots within their farm and helps in the following three areas:
  * Scans farm for non-plot files and allows you to delete them 
  * Scan the farm for duplicates and allows you to easily keep one version and clear up space.
  * (Coming up later) Move plots within farm to maximize space usage and clear up space to add more plots
